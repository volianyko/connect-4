## ðŸŽ® How to Play 

**Goal:** drop your discs so you get **four in a row** before the AI does - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

### Start a game
1. Run the server and open the page in your browser (run app.py and open the localhost).
2. Youâ€™ll see a 7Ã—6 board. **Youâ€™re yellow**, the AI is **red**.

### Your move
- Hover over the top row and **click**. Your disc falls to the lowest empty spot.
- The **AI replies automatically**. No need to press anything.

### How you win
- **Win:** make a line of **4** of your discs (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- **Lose:** the AI gets there first.
- **Draw:** the board fills up and nobody has four.

### Restart
- Want a rematch? **Refresh the page**.
